# OffensiveSecurity
OffensiveSecurity is a curated collection of scripts, tools, and write-ups focused on offensive operations for cloud and enterprise environments. The repository is organized by target area (cloud providers, Active Directory, web, AI) and by technique (enumeration, persistence, privilege escalation, data exfiltration).

This project is intended for education, defensive research, red-team exercises, and authorized penetration testing only. Do not use these tools or techniques against systems for which you do not have explicit permission.

## Repository layout
- `AD/` - Active Directory enumeration and exploitation helpers.
- `AI/` - AI-related tooling and research artifacts (prompts, model enumeration, misuse analysis).
- `Cloud/` - Cloud provider collections and provider-specific subfolders:
	- `Cloud/AWS/`
	- `Cloud/Azure/`
	- `Cloud/GCP/`
- `Web/` - Web application enumeration and exploitation helpers.

##  Guiding principles
- Purpose: Provide compact, well-documented examples for learning offensive techniques and defenses.
- Safety: All content includes disclaimers and safe usage notes. Test in isolated, authorized labs.
- Contribution: PRs welcome. Describe test environment and references.

See the individual folder READMEs for usage, example commands, and a list of included scripts.
