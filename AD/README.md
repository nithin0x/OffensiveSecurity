(# Active Directory (AD)

This folder contains scripts, notes, and tools focused on Active Directory enumeration, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence techniques used during red-team engagements and security research.

Contents
- `enumeration/` - scripts and helpers to enumerate users, groups, ACLs, trusts, GPOs.
- `privesc/` - examples and scripts for common AD privilege escalation techniques (Kerberoast, AS-REP roast, DCSync hints).
- `persistence/` - safe examples of persistence techniques used in lab environments.

Usage
- Each script should include usage examples in its header or README inside subfolders.
- Test everything in isolated lab environments (VMs, AD labs) with permission.

Safety & Legal
Only use these techniques against systems you own or have written permission to test. Many AD attacks are disruptive and may be illegal outside of authorized testing.

Contributing
- Open issues for suggested additions.
- Provide references, test notes, and proof-of-concept descriptions for any scripts you add.
