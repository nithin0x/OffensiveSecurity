# Active Directory (AD)

This folder contains scripts, notes, and tools focused on Active Directory enumeration, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence techniques used during red-team engagements and security research.

## Safety & Legal
Only use these techniques against systems you own or have written permission to test. Many AD attacks are disruptive and may be illegal outside of authorized testing.

## Contributing
- Open issues for suggested additions.
- Provide references, test notes, and proof-of-concept descriptions for any scripts you add.
