(# Web

This folder contains web application enumeration and exploitation helpers. Content typically includes automation scripts for discovery, parameter fuzzing, authentication bypass patterns, and data exfiltration proofs-of-concept.

Typical folders
- `recon/` - passive and active reconnaissance helpers
- `auth/` - scripts for brute forcing, session handling, and token analysis
- `exfiltration/` - proof-of-concept scripts demonstrating data extraction techniques

Usage
- Include usage examples in each script and avoid running noisy scans against third-party infrastructure without permission.

Safety & Legal
Only test against targets you own or have explicit permission to test. Many web scans are intrusive and may be blocked or interpreted as attacks.

Contributing
PRs should include a description of the testing environment and any resources required to validate the script.
