(# Cloud

This folder holds cloud-specific tooling, scripts, and write-ups for common offensive operations across major cloud providers. The material is organized into provider subfolders (`AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`).

Common script categories
- `enumeration` — discover resources, identities, roles, permissions, metadata endpoints.
- `privesc` — privilege escalation patterns such as misconfigured roles, identity chaining, and lateral movement.
- `persistence` — long-lived access techniques in cloud environments (e.g., compromised service principals, long-lived keys).
- `exfiltration` — methods for extracting data from cloud storage, databases, or object stores.

Provider folders include README files with provider-specific guidance, example commands, and references.

Safety & Legal
Cloud offensive techniques can cause financial loss and service disruption. Use strictly in authorized, isolated environments.

Contributing
Add repository references, test notes, and clear usage instructions for each script.
